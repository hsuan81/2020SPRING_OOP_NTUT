## Problems



In this assignment, you are asked to implement a queue with basic push and pop method, both push and pop operate with O(n) time complexity(). Size of the allocated array in queue always match the size of queue after push and pop, you need to manage memory by yourself and you are not allow to use any stl container(ex. std::vector or std::array ...) or you will get 0 point. We provide part of TA test for you to design class interface but **you still need to test it by yourself**.

Please implement these class and methods("?" means do it yourself):

-   Queue::Quene()
-   Queue::~Queue()
-   ? Queue::push(?)
-   ? Queue::pop(?)
-   ? Queue::at(?)
-   ? Queue::size(?)
-   ? Queue::clear(?)
